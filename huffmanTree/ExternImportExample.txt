Madame Curie was the envy of the world, but she was never enamoured by the many honors she received. A friend of Madame Curie's was once invited to her home and was surprised to see her young daughter playing with a gold medal that had just been awarded to her by the Royal Society. " Madame Curie smiled and said, "I just want children to know from an early age that honors are like toys, they can only be played with, they must never be held onto forever or they will get nowhere." Holding on to achievements will get you nowhere, and it is really important to be able to see that. 
From the story I learn that indifference is a kind of open-minded attitude towards life. Those who are able to be indifferent will see things outside of themselves as a matter of course, and maintain a balance between the material and spiritual worlds. To be indifferent is not to be inactive or unmotivated, but to face life with a pure heart and to savour honor with a calm mind. It is perhaps for this reason that Madame Curie is the only woman scientist in the world today to have won the Nobel Prize twice.
